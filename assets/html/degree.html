This led me to enrol in the Computer Science and Engineering programme at the Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (now Nova School of Science and Technology).<br><br>It was here that I deepened my love for programming and studying, while developing a keen interest in understanding how software and systems work at a lower level. I have fond memories of the Computer Networking classes, where I learned how data is transmitted around the world through the Internet, the data structures and algorithms implemented from scratch in Java, and the programming of a file system in C, falling more and more in love with computer science every year.</p></div></div><div class="flex flex-col items-center w-full lg:flex-row lg:items-start pb-56 lg:pb-20 lg:flex-row-reverse"><div class="w-9/12 h-fit bg-white mb-8 lg:w-5/12 lg:mb-4"><img src="./assets/images/research_image.svg" class="bg-white border-2 border-black rounded-md p-4"></div><div class="w-full font-medium tracking-wide pb-10 lg:me-10"><p>One particular subject that really piqued my interest was Distributed Systems, which led me to take part in an undergraduate research project in my final year. Together with the NOVA LINCS team led by Professor João Leitão, I worked on finding ways to optimise a variant of the Memcached library, focusing on analysing the differences in performance when using UDP vs. TCP.<br><br>This project further fueled my interest in learning new technologies and understanding how they work at a deeper level, while also developing my research and analytical skills.</p></div></div></div></div>

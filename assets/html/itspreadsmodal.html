The starting point was a randomly generated word - "spreads" - and I proposed to myself to finish the game in 1 week. A kind of personal game jam.<br><br>This was a really fun project that challenged me to conceptualise a game, design and implement different game systems, and also fuel my creativity through level design.<br><br>Be sure to try the game on a desktop as it was not designed with mobile devices in mind.</p><button class="hidden bg-black font-medium border border-black rounded-md px-4 py-2 w-fit lg:inline" onclick="window.location.href=&#39;./assets/html/itspreads.html&#39;">Play the game!</button></div></div></div>

We would then design and implement solutions to the problems, documenting every step of the process.<br><br>This was a wonderful opportunity to consolidate the Java knowledge I had gained at university through a real use case, and to extend it by learning Spring Boot and exploring topics such as VThreads, reactive programming (Webflux) and native image compilation (GraalVM). It was also a good opportunity to learn more about system design and Redis.<br><br>It was a great environment for personal development as the nature of the job incentivised me to do a lot of research into different technologies and analyse complex codebases.</p></div></div></div></div>
